# Airbnb-NYC-2019
Exploratory Data Analysis on NYC Airbnb 2019 dataset.
 
 Problem Statement:
This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical 
and numeric values. 
Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as:
❖ What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
❖ What can we learn from predictions? (Ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc.)
❖ Which hosts are the busiest and why?
❖ Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason 
for it?
Our Approach: 
Our first step was to understand the dataset of Airbnb NYC (New York City) bookings and then we 
started exploring and analyzing each column. And we found out that we need to clean our dataset 
before performing the exploratory data analysis in order to get more accurate outcomes. Hence took 
the following steps: 
❖ We treated null values of different columns accordingly. 
❖ We removed rows where; price was equal to zero. 
❖ We handled the outliers from columns. 
❖ We looked for data dependencies in our dataset. 
After cleaning our dataset, we started with our data visualization on the basis of categorical columns 
and problem statements. 
Key Findings: 
 Sonder (NYC) from Manhattan has the highest Number of Listing, followed by Blueground and 
Kara. 
 With 44% Manhattan has the highest no of bookings compare to all other neighborhood group 
followed by Brooklyn with 41.3% 
 Top Two neighborhood Group, Manhattan and Brooklyn contribute the 85.3% of total Bookings. 
 Williamsburg with 3878 total number booking at the top Followed by Bedford-Stuyvesant from 
Brooklyn. 
 Manhattan his slightly lower reviews 39.9%, compare to the percentage of total booking which is 
44%. 
 Total night stayed by all customer for a Blueground is highest with 6720 nights in total followed 
by Sonder (NYC) with 4337 nights. 
Conclusion:
❖ We can conclude from the analysis that Manhattan is the Top neighborhood group by 
number of listings and highest rental prices 7 out of 10 top Host are from Manhattan 
followed by Brooklyn. One of the Probable reasons for most preferred Neighbor Group is 
that Manhattan is a world-famous for its museums, stores, parks and theatres - and its 
substantial number of tourists thus attract Entire Home/Apt as favorite stay options and 
stayed longer, as demand is high prices are much higher in this borough. 
❖ Brooklyn also has significant number of bookings because in Brooklyn some famous 
bridges, parks, museums, islands and other tourist places but with more affordable 
prices as compared to Manhattan. It also received the maximum number of reviews. 
❖ Other Three neighborhood groups namely Queens, Bronx and Staten island are 
observing very less listing options available, especially on Staten Island. Considering 
that those are residential areas, it is possible that many guests choose these locations 
to save up money or perhaps to visit family and friends who live in this area
